\section{The Metacircular Evaluator}

\subsection{The Core of the Evaluator}

\begin{exe}[4.1]
    We can put the value to evaluate first inside a \vscm{let} expression. Since 
    the \vscm{let} is transformed into a \vscm{lambda} internally, we know that 
    its argument will be evaluated before the body of the \vscm{let}.

\subsection{Representing Expressions}

\begin{exe}[4.2]
    \ \vspace{-20pt}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] The test to determine whether an expression is a procedure 
	    just checks whether it is a pair, so it will return true for all 
	    list expressions: \vscm{if}, \vscm{cond}, \vscm{begin}, 
	    \vscm{define}, \vscm{set!}, etc., and the evaluator will try to 
	    apply the procedure \vscm{if}, \vscm{cond}, etc. to the rest of the 
	    arguments. Itâ€™s not possible to transform the special forms into 
	    procedures because all the arguments of a procedure are evaluated 
	    before evaluation.
	\item[b.] The only required change to \vscm{eval} is to put the 
	    \vscm{application?} test first. Then we only need changing the 
	    definition of the \vscm{application?} predicate and the associated 
	    selectors so they reflect the new syntax.
